# School-District-Analysis

## Challenge Overvier
Maria has asked us to complete a set of tasks using standardized test scores from a school district.

1. Replace the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
2. Compare the new district and school summaries from the original distrcit and school summaries.
3. Recalculate the high- and low-performing schools.
4. Compare how recalculating the math and reading scores affects:
 - Math and Reading Scores by Grade
 - Scores by School Spending
 - Scores by School Size
 - Scores by School Type
 
## Resources Used
Data Source: school_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook

The analysis of the standadarized test scores from the school district shows that when the scores of the ninth-graders at Thomas High School we replaced:

  - The The Percent Passing Math, Percent Passing Reading, and the Percent Overall Passing in the district summary dropped by one percent in each category. However, the average math and average reading score remains about the same.
  - Similarly, the Percent Passing Math, Percent Passing Reading, and the Percent Overall Passing in the school summary dropped by about 25-30% in each category.
  - Thomas High School went from being the 2nd highest performing school to the 8th highest perfomring school.
  - The math and reading scores by grade were unaffected.
  - The average math and reading scores in the $630-644 spending range was unaffected. However, the percent passing for math, reading and overall dropped by 6%, 7%, and 7%, respectively.
